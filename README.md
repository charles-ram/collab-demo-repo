# Karaoke Dokie Application

## Description

-This application allows karaoke singers (Users) to conduct searches of sample song lyrics which return a list of possible matches, displaying the song artist, title, and sample lyrics. By clicking one of the possible matches, Users can watch and listen to a corresponding video on a separate page. If Users would like to remember the song for future performances, they can add it to their locally-stored "Set-List," which is visible on a third page.

-This applicacation allows Users to identify songs (artist and title) by searching a sample of lyrics, utilizing Shazam API.

-The first page's search returns a list of possible song matches, listing song artist, song title, and matching lyrics for reference. Users can click a possible song match, which will open up the video-review page.

-On the video-review page, youtube API is employed to cue the corresponding music video for Users to watch. If there is a "lyrics video," that output will be prioritized. 

-After listening to the song, Users can choose to add it to a locally-stored "set-list." A listing of stored songs is visible on a third page, which can be accessed before each performance.
