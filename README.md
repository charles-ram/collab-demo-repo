## Description

-This applicacation allows Users to identify songs (artist and title) by searching a sample of lyrics, utilizing (TBD) API.

-The first page's search returns a list of possible song matches, listing artist name, song title, and matching lyrics for reference.

-On the second page, Users can search for a corresponding music video using youtube API. If there is a "lyrics video," that output will be prioritized.
