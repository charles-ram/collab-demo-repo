# Karaoke Dokie Application

## Description

This project was made using server-side api's, an external css framework, and other third-party apis such as jquery to develop an application that allows users to search for songs by lyrics. After finding a song using the search function it will allow them to listen a youtube video of the song through youtube and to save certain songs to a set-list.

## Installation

To install this application, download the files in the Github.

## Prerequisites

In order to install this application and edit the code you must have a text editor installed. The one used for this project was Visual Studio Code. This project also uses the Tailwind CSS framework, jquery library, youtube's developer API, and an API through Rapid Api/Shazam to search for song lyrics. Make sure the API's are up to date before working on the code.

## Features

-This application allows karaoke singers (Users) to conduct searches of sample song lyrics which return a list of possible matches, displaying the song artist, title, and sample lyrics. By clicking one of the possible matches, Users can watch and listen to a corresponding video on a separate page. If Users would like to remember the song for future performances, they can add it to their locally-stored "Set-List," which is visible on a third page.

-This applicacation allows Users to identify songs (artist and title) by searching a sample of lyrics, utilizing Shazam API.

-The first page's search returns a list of possible song matches, listing song artist, song title, and matching lyrics for reference. Users can click a possible song match, which will open up the video-review page.

-On the video-review page, youtube API is employed to cue the corresponding music video for Users to watch. If there is a "lyrics video," that output will be prioritized. 

-After listening to the song, Users can choose to add it to a locally-stored "set-list." A listing of stored songs is visible on a third page, which can be accessed before each performance.

## Usage

Use the search bar on the main page to find songs by lyrics. After selecting the song play a youtube video of the song by clicking the play button. Save the song to a set list by clicking add to set list.
