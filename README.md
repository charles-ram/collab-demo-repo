# Karaoke Dokie Application

## Description

-The "Karaoke Dokie" application allows karaoke singers (Users) to search for songs, review accompanying videos, and add preferred songs to a stored set-list for future karaoke use. This application was made using an external CSS framework, with web-based API, third-party API, and server-side API for functionality.

-This application allows Users to conduct song searches using artist, title, or sample song lyrics. Using Shazam API, the application returns a list of possible song matches, displaying the song artist, title, and sample lyrics. 

-The User can then click one of the possible song matches to load a second page where they can watch and/or listen to a corresponding video, generated using YouTube API. 

-If Users would like to remember the song for future performances, they can add it to their locally-stored "Set-List," which is printed to a third page. The rendered set-list allows Users to edit and update their set-list as needed.
